      Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in the
      world. This is, in part, thanks to its versatility. Python is
      considered a multi-paradigm coding language, which means that it
      allows programmers to take different approaches to achieve their
      goals, including procedural, functional, and object-oriented
      programming. One thing that really adds to Pythonâ€™s popularity is its
      readability. Python emphasizes intuitive syntax, simplifying the
      coding process overall. Also, Python has a strong support community so
      if you ever need tips or solutions, a quick trip to Stack Overflow
      will usually provide the answer.
